- I'm EssSaw
- I've just started learning programming for a year (since 2023) and I`m really interested in games and apps development.
- I'm on my way to be a great game developer so look forward for my future projects 😉😉😉. (It depends, I'm lazy af)
- Currently learning JS because I found designing with frontend tools a lil' interesting.
